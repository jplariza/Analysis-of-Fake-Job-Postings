# Analysis-of-Fake-Job-Postings
Presented by the Busch Consulting Group (Joann Lariza, Anish Gupta, Yingfan He)

### Overview 
In recent years, reports of fraudulent job postings on the internet have surged as more and more people rely on the internet when searching for employment opportunities. These fake job postings are typically used to steal personal information and identities from unassuming applicants for malicious purposes. 

We wanted to analyze the attributes that make up a fake job posting.

### Status (as of 11/05/2022)
This project was done in 24 hours, we analyzed the key attributes the best we could within the time period. That being said there may be several relationships missing and will be updated as we work on it further. 

### Code
We mainly used R and Microsoft Excel to develop the graphs we used for our analysis. 
As of libraries in R, we used ggplot2, tidyverse, dplyr, and plotly to make our visualizations 

### Installation
If you would like to follow along and run the code yourself, you will need RStudio to run R or open the CSV file provided and create the graphs through Excel.  
From there you will be able to see the graphs that we developed.
