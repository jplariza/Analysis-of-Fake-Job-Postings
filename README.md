# Analysis-of-Fake-Job-Postings
Presented by the Busch Consulting Group (Joann Lariza, Anish Gupta, Yingfan He)

### Overview 
In recent years, reports of fraudulent job postings on the internet have surged as more and more people rely on the internet when searching for employment opportunities, using job search engines such as LinkedIn and Handshake. These fake job postings are typically used to steal personal information and identities from unassuming applicants for malicious purposes. 

We wanted to analyze the attributes that make up a fake job posting. From our conclusions, we hope that you remain vigilant and proactive with reporting any suspicious activity. 

### Status (as of 11/05/2022)
This project was done in 24 hours, we analyzed the key attributes the best we could within the time period. That being said there may be several relationships missing and will be updated as we work on it further. 

### Code
We mainly used R and Microsoft Excel to develop the graphs we used for our analysis. 
We used libraries such as ggplotly, ggplot2, tidyverse, shiny (and more!) to make our visualizations. Please refer to our R-Markdown file to access the many interactive visualizations we created and the code to create them. 

### Installation
If you would like to follow along and run the code yourself, you will need RStudio to run R or open the CSV file provided and create the graphs through Excel.  
From there you will be able to see the graphs that we developed.
